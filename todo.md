Issues
* canSubmit behavior - currently an issue with checking state and enabling/disabling submit button, maybe an async issue, maybe an issue with MUI component library possible UN/PWD minimum? don't have enough time to address but ideally just shouldn't be able to submit empty text fields, currently reading state 3x instead of twice I think, but reading and logging state fine
